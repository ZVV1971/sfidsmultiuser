# sfidsmultiuser

The CLI utility intended to fill up the gap in the IICS functionallity to deal with masking (securely backing-up of) big attachements not rarely present now in SalesForce orgs.
If the bottle-neck of the flow lies not on the network part then the utility may help to boost down/up-load time by using multithreading (SF unfortunatelly doesn't allow bulk processing in the case of attachments).
